# Ignite Spring Boot Demo

This repository contains a minimal but well-structured Spring Boot application created specifically for testing cloud deployments on **Viduli**.  
It is designed to help verify:

- Build and deployment flows  
- Build customization features  
- Automatic rebuilds on GitHub push  
- Free Tier vs Paid Tier behavior  
- Basic runtime functionality and logs  

Although small, the project follows clear structure and production-friendly conventions, making it suitable for QA validation and platform testing.

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Spring Web**
- **Spring Boot Actuator** (optional, included)
- **Maven** (or Maven Wrapper)

This stack ensures fast startup, small build size, and easy cloud deployment.

##  Project Overview

The application exposes two simple endpoints:

1. A JSON response endpoint (`/java-app`)
2. A basic health check endpoint (`/health`)

These endpoints are intentionally minimal to make deployment testing fast and reliable while still validating key platform features such as routing, logs, environment variables, and rebuilds.

Each class is small and easy to understand , ideal for testing cloud builds.

##  API Endpoints

### **1) `/java-app`**
A simple JSON response used as the primary test endpoint.

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Hello from Viduli QA Test!"
}

```
Purpose:

Verify the app deployed successfully

Confirm routing is working

Validate changes after rebuilds
## /health
 Simple text response indicating application health.
``` text
UP
```
Purpose:

Quick readiness check

Used during debugging or verifying instance restarts
